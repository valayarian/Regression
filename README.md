# Regression
## Likert Scale Score prediction on Microsuturing Images
1. Implemented Linear Regression on the features extracted from the images and Applied gradient descent
algorithm on mean squared error (MSE) loss, experimenting with learning rates and stopping criteria.
2. Performed Ridge regression to handle the correlation among parameters and executed Feature selection
using SelectKBest and SelectFromModel methods to predict the value of score using lesser number of features.
